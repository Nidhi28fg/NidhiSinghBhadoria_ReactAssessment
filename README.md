Hello Sir, I created the BasketballPlayerCard.jsx component. In this component, I created a div with the class name "Player-card." Then I added an img HTML element within the "class-player-card." Below that, I created another div with the class name "Player-info." In this div, I added all the information related to the player. There are three sections in this div. The first section is an h3 element, in which I added the player's name. The second section is a p element, in which I added the player's position. The last section is a ul element, in which I added information related to the player's stats. I then created the BasketballPlayerCard.css file. In this file, I added a lot of CSS properties to give the BasketballPlayerCard.jsx a unique style. The body background color is aqua. I added "@media (max-width: 768px)" to create a responsive website. I also added flex properties, borders, max-width, box shadows, and more properties. In app.jsx, I added props related to BasketballPlayerCard.jsx. I hope you like my project. Thanks, Nidhi Singh Bhadoria
